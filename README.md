# Nirmal Bharat
SIH Final project- Nirmal Bharat

# Problem Statement
Suggest a solution to help municipal bodies maximise solid waste collection with their given resources.

# Structure
This is a WebApp which contains 3 tabs
1. Admin (Municipal corporation)
2. Employee (Curbside Truck driver)
3. User (People like us)

# Features
1. Credits: Admin will some send credits to user on the basis of how much solid waste he/she gives to curbside truck driver. These credits will later on be used to deduct water bill or house tax.
2. Schedule The Pickup: There is also a option of sending pickup request for solid waste. Curbside truck will come to pick your solid waste only after getting a full-proof photo of solid waste.
3. Live-Tracking: User can track the curbside truck so that if he/she misses the truck then they would be able to catch it soon. Admin can see all the curbside truck on map as well.
4. Dynammic Route Planning: Developed a feacture to plan the route of the curbside truck dynamically.
5. Checking Waste: Feature to check wheather the solid waste is Biodegradable or Non-Biodegradable.

# Solution (Prototype)
We will give users reward to dispose the solid waste and then convert those rewards into deduction of water bill. 

# Problems (Stated by Evaluators)
1. What is the total cost which Municipal corporation has to suffer during the implimentation of this project?
2. How will you make sure that older people, who are responsible for dispossal of waste, are comfortable with this tech and UI?
3. What if someone clicks wrong pictures of waste and uploads it just to get some credits?
4. WHat if a curbside truck driver is not following the rules and involves himself in some corruption?
5. Why would people install your App?

# Solutions (During hackathon)
1. Municipal corporation has to train some curbside truck drivers to give credits based on user's waste and they have to bear the cost of hosting the server.
2. For the comfort os users, we made the simplest possible UI. You just have to press a button and then boom. We also made a android app so that everyone can access it around the globe.
3. We have implemented a ML model known as BOTO which tells you if there is waste in that clicked picture or not, in our android app.
4. For corruption related problems, we have estabilish a one-to-one communication between Employee and the User. Afterwards, A small trainig part is also added.
5. Firstly, people are getting credits and talking about reach, we made an API which grab data from user and give that to our website. We have created a opetion to book a curbside truck for pickup under orders menu in zomato. If user checks it then his/her name, location will be sent to the website and automatically books the pickup appointment.
6. We have also build an alarm system in which when a curbside truck enter in 100m radius then it starts ringing in your phone that curbside truck is near.
